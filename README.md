# Cell-network
Overview
This Java project implements a simulation of a cell network using cellular automata. Each cell evolves based on its connections with other cells and specified input values. The goal is to model and understand the complex emergent behaviors in an interconnected cell network.

## Key Features
Dynamic simulation of the network's evolution over time.
Reading the network structure from a description file.
Processing input values from a dedicated file.
Evaluating logical predicates to determine the future state of each cell.

## Getting Started
Run the App.java file to start the simulation.
Customize the network structure by modifying the nomFichierReseau.txt file.
Change input values in the nomFichierValeur.txt file to observe different scenarios.
